# Delivery-Optimization-System
## This project is a delivery routing optimizer that uses Greedy, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms to minimize the total travel distance of delivery vehicles while considering package priorities and vehicle capacities.
## this project was a part of AI course 
### ðŸš€ Features
-Greedy initial assignment of packages to vehicles based on weight and capacity.

-Optimizes delivery routes using:

ðŸ§Š Simulated Annealing

ðŸ§¬ Genetic Algorithm

-Priority-aware distance cost function.

-Interactive CLI with input validation.

-Visualization of initial and optimized routes using matplotlib.

-Displays execution time and route efficiency improvement.
